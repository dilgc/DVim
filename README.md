My Vim config
This is just my nvim configuration, made public for my convenience in using it on other machines
Consequentially, it is only made to be seen and understood by me


-- Main locations for init.lua --
Windows - C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\nvim
Linux - /home/USERNAME/.config/nvim
IntelliJ Linux - /home/USERNAME/ (init.lua should be renamed .ideavimrc)
